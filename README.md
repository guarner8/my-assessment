Work & Co Web Code Assessment

This is a copy of the [Redux Shopping Cart Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart).

To install dependencies, use the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```
yarn
```

To start a development server:

```
yarn start
```

## Setup

Please create a new, public Github repository where your assessment can be reviewed. We recommend the following steps:

- Create a repository on your personal Github. Make sure the `Initialize this repository with a README` box is unchecked.
- Visit your new repository. Copy the `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line` code provided and run it in your terminal in the same directory as this README file. It will look something like this:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-username/my-assessment.git
git push -u origin master
```

Note: You're encouraged to show your work by including multiple commits - we'll be looking through your git history.

## Tasks

1. [Implement Responsive Design](/tasks/01-responsive-design.md)
2. [Enhance Cart Functionality](/tasks/02-cart-enhancements.md)
3. [Hook Up Product API](/tasks/03-product-api.md)

You're welcome (but not required) to add any libraries you think would be helpful.

Please also update this README file: we'd love to see notes on your decision-making process, links to the most exciting pieces of code, or anything else that will give us additional context when reviewing your assessment.

Development notes:
* I have begun to look through the project's code and decided to implement the design using bootstrap and js files to style the website. 
* I will include the jsx styles objects above each file in which I am implementing individual style as to work slightly faster. I am going to write my code to be able to extract this easily and set it in a different file if needed.

Progress: 
* Top bar (logo / cart) is responsive and looks well across displays
    * Need to add shopping cart png / change font
* Image resize is responsive
* Product boxes for desktop version look good
